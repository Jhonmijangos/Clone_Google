###  Google Design

This is my layout of the Google page that I developed in the course of **HTML** and **CSS**, used a bit of  both for completed. I was interesting, although I had worked with both before I made this layout I have learned some new, the challenge was exciting.
 
 In my repository you'll find:
 
-  CSS folder
-  index.html
 
** Notices**: You must download both so that you can use.
